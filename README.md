# Frank.Libraries
A set of libraries for .net standard 2.1

### Under construction!
This repository and it's nugets are rapidly changing with breaking changes all the time. Please report bugs!

## Important TODOs:
- Create/improve GitHub Actions for:
    - PRs
    - Releases
    - Manual actions

## Background
This started as a repo to collect my many "nice-to-haves" located in my many projects over the years, then I made some nugets for fun, then someone used the nugets... Now I have an "Open Source Project", and not just a repo of random code
