# Frank.Libraries

A set of libraries for .net core

## WARNING!
This is a personal project, and is not intended for use in production. Use at your own risk as I will not be held responsible for any damages caused by using this library. Nor do I provide any support for this library. or an SLA, so changes may occur at any time without notice, so don't use dynamic "latest" in production.

## Important TODOs:

- Increase test coverage
- Create some docs
- Add actual functionality to newly added things

## Background

This started as a repo to collect my many "nice-to-haves" located in my many projects over the years, then I made some
nugets for fun, then someone used the nugets... Now I have an "Open Source Project", and not just a repo of random code
