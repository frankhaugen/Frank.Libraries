# Frank.Libraries

A set of libraries for .net

# .net6 migration

.net 6 will be suppoerted from day 1 when it's released to production in late 2021

## Important TODOs:

- Increase test coverage
- Create some docs
- Add actual functionality to newly added things

## Background

This started as a repo to collect my many "nice-to-haves" located in my many projects over the years, then I made some
nugets for fun, then someone used the nugets... Now I have an "Open Source Project", and not just a repo of random code

Big thanks to JetBrains for donating licenses to this project. ReSharper alone has improved so much in terms of
productivity and code quality, but access to the whole plethora of tools is just next-level awesome
